In this project, you will design and implement a file-copying program named filecopy.c that utilizes
ordinary pipes for inter-process communication. The program will be passed two parameters: the name of
the file to be copied and the name of the destination file. It will create a pipe (please find more info of pipe
for interprocess communication by yourself), write the contents of the source file to the pipe, and then have
a child process read from the pipe and write to the destination file.

Inter-process communication (IPC) is a fundamental concept in operating system design, allowing
processes to exchange data and synchronize their actions. Pipes are one of the simplest forms of IPC,
enabling communication between processes running on the same system. Pipes have a read end and a write
end, allowing one process to write data into the pipe while another process reads from it.
